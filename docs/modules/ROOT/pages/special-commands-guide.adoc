= Special Commands

Special commands are part of a command group named `.`

== OS Shell command

The `. !` command runs an OS command in the directory where you started the shell.
This command works only in interactive mode.

TIP: If you have difficulty running the command, you may want to try surrounding it with double quotes. However, then you would likely need to replace any double quotes within your command with single quotes.
It can get funky, so don't push this functionality too far, in practice it works well with common day-to-day tasks.

For Unix or Mac, it runs `bash -c`. For Windows, it runs `cmd /c`.
