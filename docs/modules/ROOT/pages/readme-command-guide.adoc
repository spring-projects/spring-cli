= Guide to README Commands

When you have created a `README` file, either manually or as the result of running the `ai add --preview --description "Create a JPA application"` command, you can apply the changes described in that `README` file by using the `readme apply` command.

For example, if there is a file named `README-ai-jpa.md` in the root of your project, the following command applies the changes:

[source, bash]
----
spring guide apply README-ai-jpa.md
----

You can keep track of what has changed by committing your work in Git before applying the change.
