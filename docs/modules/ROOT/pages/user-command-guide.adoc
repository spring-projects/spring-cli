= Guide to user defined commands

User defined commands let you add custom commands to the Spring CLI.
The directory structure commands represents the command and sub-command that are introduced into the shell.

For example, the directory structure of `controller\new` translates to the command `controller new` in the CLI.

The files located in the sub-command directory are:

  * A file named `command.yaml` that describes the command and its arguments.
  * One or more Action Files that describe the actions to take to add code or configuration to the project.

User defined commands are registered with the CLI using the command
```
command add --from <repository-url>
```
The contents of that repository are copied into your existing project.

As an example, look at the contents of the repository https://github.com/rd-1-2022/udc-spring-controller

== Structure

The directory structure for all user defined commands are under the path

```
.spring/commands
```

So for the user defined command `controller new` mentioned previously, the full directory structure where the command description file and action files are located would be
```
.spring/commands/controller/new
```

Inside this directory you can define

  * The file `command.yaml` that describes what the command does and the arguments of the command
  * One or more Action Files that define the actions to execute for this command.

For example, the directory contents of the repository https://github.com/rd-1-2022/udc-spring-controller are

```
.
├── README.adoc
└── .spring
    └── commands
        └── controller
            └── new
                ├── command.yaml
                ├── create-controller.yaml
                └── RestController.java

```

=== Describing the command

The contents of the `command.yaml` file for the `controller new` command mentioned previously is:

```
command:
  description: Generate a new Spring Controller
  options:
    #
    - name: feature
      description: name of the feature package
      dataType: string
      defaultValue: person
      inputType: text
      required: true
```

The file contains a brief description of the command and an array of command line options.

The `name` of the options is required.  The default `dataType` is `string`

The `dataType` can be `int`, `integer`, `bool`, `boolean`, `double`, `float`, `long`, `short`, and `string`.

The CLI incorporates these commands at runtime and appear when asking for general help and the command help.

```
$spring help

<output truncated>

User-defined Commands
       controller new: Generate a new Spring Controller
```

and

```
$ spring help controller new
NAME
       controller new - Generate a new Spring Controller

SYNOPSIS
       controller new --feature String

OPTIONS
       --feature String
       name of the feature package
       [Optional, default = person]
```

=== Action Files
Action files are structred similar to GitHub Action files.

Acitons files can be named anything you like, the CLI will look for files with a `.yaml` or `.yml` file extension

There can be as many action files as you need to accomplish a specific task.  The order of Action Files execution is depth first and alphabetical.

Here is a very simple example

```
actions:
  - generate:
      to: hello.txt
      text: Hello at {{now}} on {{os-name}}.
```

This will generate the file `hello.txt`, if it does not already exist, in the current working directory.
The template contents contains kebab-case variable names.

The variables `user-name` and `os-name` come from Java system properties and are automatically registered with the template engine.
The variable `now` is the value of `new java.util.Date()` when the command was executed.

As a more realistic example to create Java code, the Action File named `Controller.java` in the repository https://github.com/rd-1-2022/udc-spring-controller is shown below.  The `feature` variable is a command option

* Command File

```
command:
  description: Generate a new Spring Controller
  options:
    #
    - name: feature
      description: name of the feature package
      dataType: string
      defaultValue: person
      inputType: text

```

* Action File

```yml
actions:
  - generate:
      to: src/main/java/{{root-package-dir}}/{{feature}}/{{capitalizeFirst feature}}Controller.java
      from: RestController.java
```

* Templated Java File

The file `RestController.java` is a templated text file shown below:

```java
package {{root-package}}.{{feature}};

import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;

@RestController
public class {{capitalizeFirst feature}}Controller {

	@GetMapping("/{{feature}}")
	public String greeting() {
		return "Hello {{feature}}";
	}
}
```

The `to:` field defines the location of the file to be generated.


If the file to generate already exists, it will not be overwritten unless the additional field `overwrite:` at the same level of `generate` is added at the same level of the `to:` field.

All command line arguments are passed to the template engine as variables, in this case the `feature` option.

One of the useful built-in variables is `root-package-dir` which is the directory where the class containing the `@SpringApplication` annotation is located.


== Template Engine

The template engine is https://github.com/jknack/handlebars.java[Handlebars].
Several Handlebar helpers are registered by default

  * https://github.com/jknack/handlebars.java#string-helpers[StringHelpers]
  * https://github.com/jknack/handlebars.java#humanize[HumanizeHelper]
  * https://github.com/jknack/handlebars.java#conditional-helpers[Conditional Helpers]

In the previous example, the template variable `{{capitalizeFirst feature}}` is an example of using a Handlebar helper

Several system variables are exposed to the template engine by default.

  * `System.getProperties()` is available under `{{system-properties}}`
  * `System.getenv()` is available under `{{system-environment}}`
  * The current time defined by `new Date().toString()` is available under `{{now}}`
  * The System Property `java.io.tmpdir` is available under `{{tmp-dir}}`
  * The System Property `file.separator` is available under `{{file-separator}}`
  * The System Property `os.name` is available under `{{os-name}}`
  * The System Property `user.name` is available under `{{user.name}}`

The Java package name where the Spring Boot main application class resides is available under `{{root-package}}`

The directory where the Spring Boot main applicaiton class resides is available under `{{root-package-dir}}`

The Maven model exposes several variables:

  * `{{artifact-id}}`
  * `{{artifact-version}}`
  * `{{artifact-path}}`
  * `{{project-name}}`
  * `{{project-descriptoin}}`
  * `{{maven-model}` - This the class https://maven.apache.org/ref/3.9.0/maven-model/apidocs/org/apache/maven/model/Model.html[org.apache.maven.model.Model]
  * `{{maven-properties}}` - This is a Java Properties object that has as keys, the values of what each entry in the POM's `<properties>` section.
  * `{{java-version}}` - This looks for a Maven Property in the POM of the name `java.version`.  If it the value is `1.8`, it is converted to the value `8`.

== Creating a new user defined command

A simple way to get started is to run the command

```
spring command new hello create
```

This creates an user defined command named `hello` with the sub-command named `create`.

You can view the full set of options for `spring command new` by executing `spring command new --help`.
The output is shown below.

```
$ spring command new --help
NAME
       command new - Create a new user-defined command

SYNOPSIS
       command new --commandName String --subCommandName String --path String --help

OPTIONS
       --commandName String
       The name of the user-defined command to create
       [Optional, default = hello]

       --subCommandName String
       The name of the user-defined sub-command to create
       [Optional, default = new]

       --path String
       Path to execute command in
       [Optional]

       --help or -h
       help for command new
       [Optional]
```

Executing `spring command new hello create` generates following directory structure and files as discussed previously.

```
.
├── README.adoc
└── .spring
    └── commands
        └── hello
            └── create
                ├── command.yaml
                └── hello.yaml

```

The contents of the `command.yaml` file is shown below.  It contains one command line argument, named `greeting`

```
command:
  description: Generate a new file with a hello message
  options:
    #
    - name: greeting
      description: who or what to say hello to
      dataType: string
      defaultValue: World
      inputType: text     # TEXT
```

And the action file `hello.yaml` is shown below.  It generates the file named `hello.txt`

```
actions:
  - generate: 
      to: hello.txt
      text: Hello {{greeting}} at {{now}} on {{os-name}}.
```

The command is listed under the heading `User-defined Commands` when executing the command `spring help`.

```
...
User-defined Commands
       hello create: Generate a new file with a hello message
```


Executing the command `spring hello create` generates the file hello.txt with the following contents:

```
Hello World at Mar 9, 2023 on Linux.
```
